Gesture recognition with mobilenet and custom architecture - great study purpose project

Demo: https://youtu.be/CmvcJKIH52I

Welcome to a hands-on demonstration of my real-time gesture recognition system built using deep learning! In this screencast, you'll see a practical application of AI that interprets human hand gestures directly from video input.

üîç What This Project Is About:
This video showcases a gesture recognition model that I developed as part of a deep learning study last year. Even though the technology might not be the absolute cutting-edge of today, it's a powerful and effective illustration of core AI concepts and a fantastic example for anyone looking to understand how these systems work in practice.

üß† The Technology Behind It:
We're diving into a fascinating hybrid architecture:

MobileNet (Transfer Learning): Utilized as a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extractor. It efficiently pulls out visual patterns from each frame of the video. This is a classic example of transfer learning, leveraging powerful models trained on vast image datasets.
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): An integral part of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) family, the GRU processes the sequence of features extracted by MobileNet. It's responsible for understanding the temporal dynamics and flow of gestures over time, allowing the model to make sense of the movement.
üé• In This Demo, You'll See:

A live screencast of the gesture recognition system in action.
How the model processes video input in real-time.
Predictions for different hand gestures like "Thumbs Up," "Thumbs Down," "Left Swipe," "Right Swipe," and "Stop."
Confidence scores for each prediction, showing how certain the model is about its output.
üí° Why This Project (Even from Last Year) Matters:
This project serves as an excellent study case and portfolio piece. It demonstrates practical skills in:

Implementing a full deep learning pipeline from data input to real-time prediction.
Applying transfer learning effectively.
Combining CNNs (for spatial features) and RNNs (for temporal dynamics) for video analysis.
Building a functional AI application.
Whether you're a student, a fellow developer, or just curious about AI, this video offers a clear look into a working gesture recognition system.
